# 🎧 Dive - TWICE Inspired Page
![TWICE Dive Preview](https://github.com/aneqlique/TWICE-DIVE/blob/main/twice.png?raw=true) 

This is a website made with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. It's inspired by the NewJeans official site (https://newjeans.kr/), but it focuses only on the TWICE song “Dive.” The site has a clean design with buttons that link to some of TWICE’s official social media pages.
