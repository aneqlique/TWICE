# ðŸŽ§ Dive - TWICE Inspired Page
![TWICE Dive Preview](https://github.com/aneqlique/TWICE-DIVE/blob/main/twice.png?raw=true) 

This website was built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. It is inspired by the official NewJeans website (https://newjeans.kr/), but it concentrates solely on the TWICE song "Dive." The site has a clean design with buttons that link to some of TWICEâ€™s official social media pages.
